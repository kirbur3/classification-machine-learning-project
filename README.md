# classification_machine_learning_project

Group Project

Data: admission.csv - 85 students who are either supposed to be admitted, borderline, or not supposed to be admitted into a graduate business program.

Coded three classification methods: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

Used training data to create the models, and both training data and testing data to evaluate them.

Plotted decision boundary plots on training data and testing data for all three classifiers.

Evaluated the performance of each of the models.

Wrote a professional report on our findings.
