# classification_machine_learning_project

Note: This project is listed on my CV & resume as "**Admission Classification with ML**".

Group Project

Data: admission.csv - eighty-five students who are either supposed to be admitted, borderline, or not supposed to be admitted into a graduate business program based on GPA and GMAT scores.

Coded three classification methods: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

Used training data to create the models, and both training data and testing data to evaluate them.

Plotted decision boundary plots on training data and testing data for all three classifiers.

Evaluated the performance of each of the models.

Wrote a professional report on our findings.
